# DevOps vs DevSecOps

---

## ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s the Difference?

| Aspect                  | DevOps                              | DevSecOps                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Main Focus**          | Speed, Collaboration between Dev & Ops  | Speed + Security (Shift-Left Security) |
| **Security Ownership**  | Mostly handled by Ops after deployment | Shared by Dev, Ops, and Security from Day 1 |
| **Security Integration** | Security added late (after development) | Security integrated in every phase (plan, develop, build, test, deploy) |
| **Key Practices**       | CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Monitoring | CI/CD + Security Automation + Continuous Compliance |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Optional or manual | Automated in every pipeline run |
| **Compliance**          | Manual or post-release checks | Automated with Compliance as Code |
| **Threat Modeling**     | Rarely part of DevOps processes | Performed early during planning & design phases |
| **Feedback Loops**      | Ops feedback to Dev | Security feedback also loops into Dev (continuous learning) |
| **Primary Goal**        | Faster Delivery                    | Faster and Secure Delivery |

## ðŸ”¥ Key Takeaway

> DevOps focuses on **faster delivery through automation and collaboration** between developers and operations.  
> DevSecOps extends this by adding **security as a shared responsibility** across all stages of the lifecycle, without slowing down delivery.

## âœ… My Personal Notes

- I found the biggest difference to be:
DevOps focuses mainly on speed, automation, and delivery, while DevSecOps ensures security is built-in from the very beginning instead of being added later. It's a mindset shift where everyone (developeres, operations, and security teams) shares responsibility for security. 
- One example of DevSecOps in real life is:
A CI/CD pipeline that automatically scans every new commit for vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk, and if a high-severity vulnerability is detected, the pipeline fails the build immediately. 
This ensures insecure code never even reaches production. 
- One question I still have is:
How do large companies (like Netflix, Google, or Amazon) manage to scale DevSecOps across hundreds of teams and thousands of microservices? What tools and best practices make that possible at such a scale?
