# DevOps vs DevSecOps

---

## ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s the Difference?

| Aspect                  | DevOps                              | DevSecOps                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Main Focus**          | Speed, Collaboration between Dev & Ops  | Speed + Security (Shift-Left Security) |
| **Security Ownership**  | Mostly handled by Ops after deployment | Shared by Dev, Ops, and Security from Day 1 |
| **Security Integration** | Security added late (after development) | Security integrated in every phase (plan, develop, build, test, deploy) |
| **Key Practices**       | CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Monitoring | CI/CD + Security Automation + Continuous Compliance |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Optional or manual | Automated in every pipeline run |
| **Compliance**          | Manual or post-release checks | Automated with Compliance as Code |
| **Threat Modeling**     | Rarely part of DevOps processes | Performed early during planning & design phases |
| **Feedback Loops**      | Ops feedback to Dev | Security feedback also loops into Dev (continuous learning) |
| **Primary Goal**        | Faster Delivery                    | Faster and Secure Delivery |

## ðŸ”¥ Key Takeaway

> DevOps focuses on **faster delivery through automation and collaboration** between developers and operations.  
> DevSecOps extends this by adding **security as a shared responsibility** across all stages of the lifecycle, without slowing down delivery.
